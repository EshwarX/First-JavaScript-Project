  This is the page.html page for the project I have done. Including
  an app design project, academic research, as well as an art project.
  It also includes my email as a way of contacting me.
  It is linked to the style.css style sheet and index.js.
  It has several interactive functions as well as a Calendarly plug-in widget.

          <p>The National Cyber League (NCL) is the most inclusive, performance-based,
            learning-centered collegiate cybersecurity competition today!
            The NCL, powered by Cyber Skyline, enables students to prepare and
            test themselves against practical cybersecurity challenges that
            they will likely face in the workforce, such as identifying
            hackers from forensic data, pentesting and auditing vulnerable
            websites, recovering from ransomware attacks, and much more!
            Me, as a student who's interested in cybersecurity, is
            enrolled in this season's competition!

            According to Global estimates, published by WHO, about 35% women
            worldwide experience violence (“any act of gender-based violence
            that resuts in… physical, sexual or mental harm”) at least once
            in their lifetimes (Violence Against Women). Such violence may
            lead to serious damages and consequences of the victims’ well-beings.
            Therefore, providing information about safety and delivering
            it to the users would be the focus of our project, and this
            is why we chose to make an interactive
            map to allow users gain needed information.

          <p>
            The demand for automatic face detection and age recognition
            has become increasingly significant for the social media
            industry and society. Most of the previous age estimation
            models are based on the presumption that the input images
            for their models are facial images of humans. In the
            real-world scenario, however, the input might not be qualified enough.
            Moreover, their estimation performance is yet to be improved.
            This paper designs a novel system for age estimation based
            on a convolutional neural network (CNN). First, a Caffe
            model is used to filter out the input which does not contain
            a face. Then, a CNN-based model is proposed to estimate ages
            from the faces detected. The performance of the proposed model
            is evaluated on the Adience benchmark dataset, surpassing a
            few previous well-known models. Finally, the model is
            deployed to the cloud to provide real-time services.
